# Introduction to Networking

i. Terms:

Packet = Unit of data.

Packet-Switching = Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.

Internet Protocol (IP) Address = Unique identifying number.

Domain Name Server (DNS) = Directory of IP address common names.

Protocol = Set of rules to allow devices to communicate.

# Networking Hardware

a. The benefit of a switch over a hub includes a switch does what a hub does, but more efficiently.  A hub is the least expensive, least intelligent, and least complicated of the three.  Its job is straightforward: anything that comes in one port is sent out to the others.  That's all.  Meanwhile, a switch pays attention to the traffic that comes across it, and it learns which computers are connected to which port.

1. Initially, a switch knows nothing, and simply sends incoming messages to all ports.

2. By accepting that first message, however, the switch has learned something: it knows on which connection the sender of the message is located.  Thus, when machine "A" responds to the message, the switch only needs to send that message out to one connection.

3. By processing the response, the switch has learned something else: it now knows on which connection machine "A" is located.  That means subsequent messages destined for machine "A" need only be sent to that one port.

b. The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is that a router is the smartest and most complicated of the three.  One way to view a router is as a computer that can be programmed to understand, manipulate, and act on the data it handles.  A router operates as a switch for basic routing: it learns the computer's location sending traffic, and routes information only to the neccessary connections.
