# Executive Summary:

In Lab 2, we reviewed the hardware components of a computer.  These components include hard drive, memory solid-state drives, Random Access Memory (RAM), 32-bit versus 64-bit paths, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Central Processing Unit (CPU), Logic Gates, and Circuits.  In addition, numeric conversions and hexadecimal color representation were discusssed.  I found that adding more RAM on a computer results in faster computer fasinating because it's similar to having more lanes of traffic available for cars to travel along the highway.

# Hardware

Hard Drives and Memory:

a) The performance of a hard drive is vital to the overall speed of the system.  Conversely, a slow hard disk has the potential to delay a fast processor.  Several factors determine the effective speed of a hard disk.  Foremost among them is the rotatinal speed of the platters.  Disk RPM is a critcal component of hard drive performance because it directly impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate.  The faster the disk spins, the more data passses under the magnetic heads that read the data; the slower the RPM, the higher the mechanical latencies.  Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head after a completed seek.

b) A solid-state drive is a storage device that uses solid-state memory to store data.  Hard disk drives have been a faithful servant to computing for many years.  However, they are most undoubtedly fallible with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and an array of other complex moving parts.  They can also be slow.  The disks are required to start spinning if they're not already doing so, additionally the head needs to be in the correct position on the disk to read or write the data.  The principle behind solid-state drives is that there should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads.  A solid-state drive utilizes memory chips to RAM.  The latency time is reduced due to the information being able to accessed instantly.  A solid-state drive acts as an oversized USB key.  If the hard drive no longer functions, the hard drive itself will begin to make noises that originate with the platters going wrong and the arm scratches the metal.  A hybrid drive contains both tangible and intangible parts, which are commonly used on platters.

i. Increasing RAM will make the computer run faster because the data or a program is first stored on the hard drive.  Next, the data goes from the hard drive and is then loaded into the RAM.  Once loaded into RAM, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) can now access the data or run the program.  However, if the memory is too low, the computer might not hold all the data that the CPU needs.  When this happens, some other data has to kept on the slower hard drive to compensate for the low memory.  As a result, the data going from RAM to the CPU has to do extra work by going back to the hard drive.  When this happens, it slows down the computer.  To solve this problem, increase the amount of RAM on a computer.  RAM is also faster because more space is available to load onto the RAM versus using the hard drive.  Because of this location change, the transmission within a computer is altered to be faster.  This is known as a cache performance.  A typical setup involves a CPU to a level 1 cache, storing data - next, the RAM component to the current, and lastly, the hard drive.

ii. The difference between 64 and 32 bit paths are as follows:
A 64-bit processor can handle more data at once.  A 64-bit processor is capable of storing more computational values, including memory addresses.  This translates to access to over 4 billion times the physical memory of a 32-bit processor.  32-bit processors are seamlessly proficient in handling a limited amount of RAM (in Windows, 4GB or less).  A 64-bit processor can utilize much more RAM.  Most software is backward compatible.  This means that the user can run applications that are 32-bit in a 64-bit environment witout any extra work or issues.  A 64-bit has a more considerable bus value within a binary value.  A bus value is a tangible lane of a chip within a computer.  You are physically able to see more circuits on a 64-bit versus a 32-bit processor.

# ALU and the Control Unit

2. An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithetic and logic operations.  It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.  Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.  ALUs are the mathematical brains of the computer.  In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs have a control unit (CU).

# CPU, Input & Output

CPU - Each computer does the same four things: Input, Store, Process, Output.  The central processing unit, or CPU, is where all of the calculations are done.  Modern computers have multiple CPUs to process all that information and many gigabytes of memory to store it.

Input - Input converts physical input to binary information - the memory stores the data.  There's a central processing unit, or CPU, where all the calculations are done.  Lastly, there are output devices that take information and convert it into physical output.  Inputs include the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone, a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.  Also, the sensors on a car, a thermostat, or a drone are different input devices.

Output - There are many different types of output.  Output takes a binary signal from the computer and does something in the physical world.  For example, a speaker will play a sound, and a 3-D printer will print an object.  Output devices can also control physical motion like a rototic arm, the motor of a car, or the cutting tool of the milling machine.

# Logic Gates and Circuits

A truth table is a table that displays the logical operations on input signals in a table format.  For example, every Boolean expression can be viewed as a truth table.  The truth table identifies all possible input combinations and the output for each.  

The NAND gate truth table compares to that of an AND gate by being the logical inverse of the OR gate.  Thus, the AND gate refers to both circuits needing to be 0 or both 1.  Each is based on certain conditions that must be met for the circuit to function.

# IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

IEEE is dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity.  The organization is the world's largest technical professional society.  IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a significant influence in society.  There was one primary established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communication system faster than the speed of transportation.  In addition, the telephone and electric power, and light industries had just gotten underway.

IEEE is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.

An important factor of ethics in device design, is that all team members must be on board with the final device outcome and its intended uses.  It must be a fair use item for all, meaning that all people can use the device.  Accessibility is critical in the final intentions.  Examples of ethical issues in device design include Uber and Lyft exploiting their drivers by forcing workers to work long hours without proper compsensation.  In addition, pre-installed voice-activated software tends to mimic that of a woman, sparking sexist overtones.  Lastly, motion detection soap dispensaries have an issue with people with a melanin deficiency and dispense no soap.

What would not be accessible would-be black text with a grey background.  Other colors include ff0000, 00ff00, and 0000ff.  These codes represent red, green, and blue.

# Conclusion

Lab 2 in IT1025 provided me with a profound understanding of Information Systems within the hardware.  I learned that Information Systems within hardware are made up of many different system components.  These components are what gives a computer its capabilites.  Adding or removing specific parts will determine the latency speed of the computer.  I also developed a better understanding of maneuvering throughout GitHub by creating documents on the website.
