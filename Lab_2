# Lab_2

Executive Summary:  In Lab 2, we reviewed the hardware components of a computer.  These components includes hard drives, memory, solid-state drive, Random Access Memory (RAM), 32-bit versus 64-bit paths, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Central Processing Unit (CPU), Logic Gates, and Circuits.  In addition numeric conversions and hexadecimal color representation were discussed.  I found that adding more RAM on a computer results in a faster computer fasinating because it's similar to having more lanes of traffic available for cars to travel along the highway.
