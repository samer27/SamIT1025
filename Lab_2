# Lab_2

Executive Summary:  In Lab 2, we reviewed the hardware components of a computer.  These components includes hard drives, memory, solid-state drive, Random Access Memory (RAM), 32-bit versus 64-bit paths, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Central Processing Unit (CPU), Logic Gates, and Circuits.  In addition numeric conversions and hexadecimal color representation were discussed.  I found that adding more RAM on a computer results in a faster computer fasinating because it's similar to having more lanes of traffic available for cars to travel along the highway.

Hard Drives and Memory

a) The performance of a hard disk is vital to the overall speed of the system.  Conversely, a slow hard disk has the potential to delay a fast processor like no other system component.  Several factors determine the effective speed of a hard disk.  Foremost among them is the rotational speed of the platters.  Disk RPM is a critical component of a hard disk performance because it directly impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate.  The faster the disk spins, the more data passes under the magnetic heads that read the data; the slower the RPM, the higher the mechanical latencies.  Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head after a completed seek.
