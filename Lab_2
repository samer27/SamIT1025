# Lab_2

Executive Summary:  In Lab 2, we reviewed the hardware components of a computer.  These components includes hard drives, memory, solid-state drive, Random Access Memory (RAM), 32-bit versus 64-bit paths, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Central Processing Unit (CPU), Logic Gates, and Circuits.  In addition numeric conversions and hexadecimal color representation were discussed.  I found that adding more RAM on a computer results in a faster computer fasinating because it's similar to having more lanes of traffic available for cars to travel along the highway.

## Hardware

Hard Drives and Memory

a) The performance of a hard disk is vital to the overall speed of the system.  Conversely, a slow hard disk has the potential to delay a fast processor like no other system component.  Several factors determine the effective speed of a hard disk.  Foremost among them is the rotational speed of the platters.  Disk RPM is a critical component of a hard disk performance because it directly impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate.  The faster the disk spins, the more data passes under the magnetic heads that read the data; the slower the RPM, the higher the mechanical latencies.  Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head after a completed seek.

b) A solid-state drive is a storage device that uses solid-state memory to store data.  Hard disk drives have been a faithful servant to computing for many years.  However, they are most undoubtedly fallible with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and an array of other complex moving parts.  They can be slow, too: disks have to start spinning if they're not already doing so, then they have to get the head to the correct position on the disk to read or write the data.  The principle behind solid-state drives is that there should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads.  The solid-state drive utilizes memory chips to RAM.  The latency time is reduced due to the information being able to be accessed instantly.  A solid-state drive acts as an oversized USB key.  If the hard drive no longer functions, the hard drive itself will begin to make noises that originate with the platters going wrong and the arm scratches the metal.  A hybrid drive contains both tangible and non-tanible parts, which are commonly used on platters.

i. Increasing RAM will make the computer run faster because data or a program is first stored on the hard drive.  Next, the data goes from the hard drive and is then loaded in the RAM.  Once loaded into RAM, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) can now access the data or run the program.  However, if the memory is too low, the computer  might not hold all the data that the CPU needs.  When this happens, some other data has to be kept on the slower hard drive to compensate for the low memory.  As a result, the data going from RAM to the CPU has to do extra work by going back to the hard drive.  When this happens, it slows down the computer.  To solve this problem, increase the amount of RAM on a computer.  More data can be loaded into the faster RAM without constantly accessing the slower hard drive by increasing the memory.  The result is a faster-performing computer.  RAM is also faster because more space is available to load onto the RAM versus using the hard drive.  Because of this location change, the transmission within the computer is altered to be faster.  This is known as a cache performance.  A typical setup involves a CPU to a level 1 cache, storing data- next, the RAM component to the current, and lastly, the hard drive.

ii. The differences between 64 and 32 data paths are as follows:
A 64-bit processor can handle more data at once.  a 64-bit processor is capable of storing more computational values, including memory addresses.  This translates to access to over 4 billion times the physical memory of a 32-bit processor.  32-bit processors are seamlessly proficient in handling a limitied amount of RAM (in Windows, 4GB or less).  A 64-bit processor can utilize much more RAM.  Most software is backward compatible.  This means that the user can run applications that are 32-bit in a 64-bit environment with any extra work or issues.  A 64-bit has a more considerable bus value within a binary value.  A bus value is a tangible lane of a chip within a computer.  You are physically able to see more circuits on a 64-bit versus a 32-bit processor.

### ALU and the Control Unit

An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.  It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.  Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.  ALUs are the mathematical brains of the computer.  In addition the ALUs, modern CPUs have a control unit (CU).

#### CPU, Input & Output

CPU - Each computer does the same four things: Input, Store, Process, Output.  The central processing unit, or CPU, is where all of the calculations are done.  Modern computers have multiple CPUs to process all that information and many gigabytes of memory to store it.

Input - Input converts physical input to binary information- the memory stores the data.  There's a central processing unit, or CPU, where all the calculations are done.  Lastly, there are output devices that take information and convert it into physical output.  Inputs include the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone, a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.  Also, the sensors on a car, a thermostat, or a drone are different input devices.

Output - There are many different types of output.
