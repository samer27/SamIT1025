Executive Summary:

## Hardware

Hard Drives and Memory

a) The performance of a hard disk is vital to the overall speed of the system.  Conversely, a slow hard disk has the potential to delay a fast processor like no other system component.  Several factors determine the effective speed of a hard disk.  Foremost among them is the rotational speed of the platters.  Disk rotations per minute or (RPM) is a critcal component of hard disk performance because it directly impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate.  The faster the disk spins, the more data passes under the magnetic heads that read the data; the slower the RPM, the higher the mechanical latencies.  Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into postion under a head after a completed seek.

b) A solid state drive is a storage device that uses solid-memory to store data.  Hard disk drives have been a faithful servant to computing for many years.  However, they are most undoubtly fallible with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and an array of other complex moving parts.  They can be slow, too: disks have to start spinning if they're are not already doing so, then they have to get the head to the correct position on the disk to read or write the data.  The principle behind solid-state drives is that there should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads.

i. Increasing RAM will make the computer run faster because data or a program is first stored on the hard drive.  Next, the data goes from the hard drive and is then loaded into the RAM.  Once loaded in the RAM, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) can now access the data or run the program.  However, if the memory is too low, the computer might not hold all the data that the CPU needs.  When this happens, some other data has to be kept on the slower hard drive to compensate for the low memory.  As a result, the data going from the RAM to the CPU has to do extra work by going back to the hard drive.  When this happens, it slows down the computer.  To solve this problem, increase the amount of RAM on a computer.  More data can be loaded into the faster RAM without constantly accessing the slower hard drive by increasing the memory.  The result is a faster-performing computer.  

ii. The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths are as follows:
A 64-bit processor can handle more data at once.  A 64-bit processor is capable of storing more computational values, including memory addressess.  This translates to access to over 4 billion times the physical memory of a 32-bit processor.  32-bit processors are seamlessly proficient in handling a limitied amount of RAM (in Windows, 4GB or less).  A 64-bit processor can utilize much more RAM.  Most software is backward compatible.  This means that the user can run applications that are 32-bit in a 64-bit environment without any extra work or issues. 

2)  An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.  It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.  Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.  ALUs are the mathematical brains of the computer.  In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs have a control unit (CU).

### CPU

Each computer does the same four things : Input, Store, Process, and Output.  The CPU is where all of the calculations are done.  Modern computers have multiple CPUs to process all that information and many gigabytes of memory to store it.

#### Input

Input converts physical input to binary information - the memory stores the data.  There's a CPU, where all the calculations are done.  Lastly, there are output devices that take information and convert it into physical output.  Inputs include the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone, a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.  Also, the sensors on a car, a thermostat, or a drone are different input devices.

##### Output

There are many different types of output.  Output takes a binary signal from the computer and does something in the physical world.  For example, a speaker will play a sound, and a 3-D printer will print an object.  Output devices can also control physical motion like a rototic arm, the motor of a car, or the cutting tool of the milling machine.
