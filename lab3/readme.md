# Executive Summary

In Lab 3, we reviewed software types, practice working with virtualization and Python.  We also explored careers in information technology, and co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry association, and student organization memberships.

# Software

1. Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web.  One example is Microsoft Word.

Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way.  Examples include anti-malware software and programs that remove software you no longer want to be installed.

Operating systems provide you with these critical functions: Managing the computer's hardware resources; Providing the user-interface components, Providing a platform for software developers to write applications.  One example is the Windows operating system.

2. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (sometimes just called enterprise software) was developed to bring together an entire organization with one program.  ERP software utilizes a central database that is implemented in the whole organization.  Here are some critical points about ERP:

A software application.  ERP is an application that is used by many of an organization's employees.
It utilizes a central database.  Therefore, all users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source.  For example, there is only one customer table in the database, one sale (revenue), table, ect.
It is implemented organization wide.  ERP systems include functionality that covers all of the essential components of a business.  An organization can purchase modules for its ERP system that match specific needs such as order entry, manufacturing, or planning.

2. The purpose of virtualization is that due to the limitations on x86 servers, many IT organizations must deploy multiple servers, each operating at a fraction of their capacity, to keep pace with today's high storage and processing demands.  The result: massive ineffciencies and high operating costs.

Enter virtualization.  Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system.  This vitual computer system enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system - and multiple operating systems and applications - on a single server.  The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.  

A virtual computer system is a "virtual machine" (VM): a tightly isolated software container with an operating system and applications inside.  Each self-contained VM is completely independent.  Putting multiple VMs on a single computer enables several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server or "host."

It differs from cloud computing because a thin layer of software called a "hypervisor" decouples the virtual machines from the host.  It dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.
