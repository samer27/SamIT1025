# Executive Summary

In Lab 3, we reviewed software types, practice working with virtualization and Python.  We also explored careers in information technology and co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry association, and student organization memberships.  I found that virtualization software benefits all IT departments by allowing access to virtual machines.  In addition, virtual machines enable multiple operating systems and applications to run on one physical server or "host."  I hope to utilize the resources made available to me through the college in the future.   

# Software

1. Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web.  One example is Microsoft Word.

Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way.  Examples include anti-malware software and programs that remove software you no longer want to be installed.

Operating systems provide you with these critical functions: Managing the computer's hardware resources; Providing the user-interface components, Providing a platform for software developers to write applications.  One example is the Windows operating system.

2. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (sometimes just called enterprise software) were developed to unite an entire organization with one program.  ERP software utilizes a central database that is implemented in the whole organization.  Here are some critical points about ERP:

A software application.  ERP is an application that is used by many of an organization's employees.
It utilizes a central database.  Therefore, all users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source.  For example, there is only one customer table in the database, one sale (revenue), table, etc.
It is implemented organization-wide.  ERP systems include functionality that covers all of the essential components of a business.  An organization can purchase modules for its ERP system that match specific needs such as order entry, manufacturing, or planning.

2. The purpose of virtualization is that due to the limitations on x86 servers, many IT organizations must deploy multiple servers, each operating at a fraction of their capacity, to keep pace with today's high storage and processing demands.  The result: massive inefficiencies and high operating costs.
Enter virtualization.  Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system.  This virtual computer system enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system - and multiple operating systems and applications - on a single server.  The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.  A virtual computer system is a "virtual machine" (VM): a tightly isolated software container with an operating system and applications inside.  Each self-contained VM is completely independent.  Putting multiple VMs on a single computer enables several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server or "host."

It differs from cloud computing because a thin layer of software called a "hypervisor" decouples the virtual machines from the host.  It dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.

# Virtualization

1. The problems solved with virtualization include reduced complexities (both management and security-based), less overhead cost, and a more flexible IT environment.  In addition, virtualization supports addressing the most pressing technology challenge: the infrastructure collapse forcing IT departments to channel 70 percent of their budget into maintenance.  Also, it's draining resources for business-building innovation.  The challenge originates from the architecture of today's x86 computers.  x86 computers are designed to run just one operating system or application at a time.  That means that even small data centers have to deploy many servers operating at just 12 percent capacity.  That's highly inefficient by any standard.  Virtualization software solves the problem by enabling multiple operating systems and applications to run on one physical server or "host." 

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system.  Clouds are IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across the network.  Or, more simply, virtualization is a technology where the cloud is a unique environment.

2. The role of hypervisor plays in virtualization, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).  A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.  As a result, hypervisor makes it possible to use more of a system's available resources and provide greater IT mobility since the guest VMs are independent of the host hardware.  In other words, this means VMs can easily be moved between servers.  In addition, because multiple virtual machines can run off of one physical server with a hypervisor, a hypervisor reduces space, energy, and maintenance requirements.

# Python

1. The "pseudo-code nature of Python" is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system.  Or, pseudo-code consists of short English phrases used to explain specific tasks within a program.  Ideally, pseudo-code should not include keywords within any particular computer language.  Instead, pseudo-code ought to be written as a list of consecutive phrases.  We can even draw arrows to show looping processes.  Indentation can be used to show the logical program flow in pseudo-code also.

Writing pseudo-code saves time later during the coding and testing stages of a program's development and helps communication between designer, coder, and project managers.  For example, some projects may use pseudo-code for design, others may use flow charts, and some a combination of both.  

2. An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted without compiling a program into machine instructions.  It is one where the target machine does not directly execute the instructions but instead reads and is executed by some other program - interpreted language ranges - JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

A compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted.  It is one where the program, once collected, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans - types of compiled language - C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.

# College Central

2. I found the College Central resource helpful as it tailors your search results to match your starting profile.  In addition, the websites gives you the option of where a student wishes to find work.  College Central is also powered by Indeed.com, a popular job searching website.  I hope to utilize the College Central resource moving forward.  

4. Bureau of Labor Statistics

I'm familiar with the Bureau of Labor Statistics website because it's featured on the Tri-C website.  Before I enrolled in college, I reviewed the site to give me a sense of where to go in the workforce.  Ultimately, I chose Cybersecurity because it aligned with my skillset and my career goals.  

# Certificates

I am interested in the Tri-C IT Cybersecurity program because all of my free time is primarily spent on the computer and assisting others with computer-related issues, such as networking and technical problems.  Because it allows me to develop a passion into a practical skill, analyze data, and perhaps most important to me, help consumers and corporations protect data and privacy in an increasingly wired way world.

# Co-ops / Internships

2. For a student to be co-op "ready," eligibility requirements include being currently enrolled at Tri-C, completed 12 credit hours of college coursework (includes transfer credits) with at least two courses related to your major field, and a GPA of 2.75 of higher.  In addition, student expectations include completing the Application of Interest, participating in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center, uploading your resume for final revisions and approval by a career coach at Handshake, and completing and signing a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form.

The benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship give students an edge by providing them with hands-on learning experience through job assignments related to their field. Not only is a job assignment vital to a student's marketability, but it allows you to use what is learned in the classroom.  In addition, the real-world experience provides insight into career paths and job opportunities.  In addition to being compensated, as in a regular work assignment, the student can earn one college credit for every 180 hours worked, up to three credits per semester.    

# Conclusion

In Lab3, we went over software types and practiced working with virtualization and Python.  We also discovered careers in information technology and co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry association, and student organization memberships.  Moving forward, I plan to apply virtualization software on my computer to give it more effitiveness and efficiency.
