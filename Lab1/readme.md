1) Executive Summary:
   The intention behind Lab 1 is to go in-depth on the IT1025 structure, revisit the history of computing, and to start from the ground up on GitHub.  IT1025 goes over various computing subjects, working towards students figuring out what their passions are within IT.  IT history has numerous fascinating sides.  Frameworks like GitHub are convenient for creating, updating, and maintaining files while working in an organized repository.  The most exciting side for me was Cybersecurity and Encryption because it allows me to develop a passion into a practical skill, analyze data, - and, perhaps most important to me, help consumers and corporations to protect their data and privacy in an increasingly wired world.
   
2) Information Systems Components:
   A Samsung smartwatch is an information system that I use every day while I exercise.  The Samsung smartwatch's hardware contains specific sensors that measure my heart rate while I am in motion.  The operating system that runs on the watch, along with the application connected to my smartphone, is software for the device.  As I exercise, data is collected and stored on the application then later measured and averaged.  In addition, people are working for Samsung composing computer code to calculate the data inputted to be processed.  Lastly, the process of exercising and measuring heart rate is repeated to gain a better understanding of one's health.
   
3) Client-Server:
   In GitHub, I'm experiencing a Client-Server architecture.  With GitHub, only the interface and the user interactions occur on the client-side (for the website), but with Git (the version control), most of the version management takes place on the client-side.  Stuff like user authentication and credential management occurs on the server and merges, tests, diffing, and comments.

GitHub is mainly a UI or 'hub' for all of the content stored on the server, while Git is a 'scm' or source control manager.  This hub is the technology responsible for versioning and 'diffing' or comparing differences between files or changes or a single file.

GitHub remains an online Git repository hosting service that offers a web-based graphical interface.  The interface allows users to synchronize their source code or projects locally into the web.  GitHub can also be utilized to view other user's repositories and download code or documents without trouble.  The essential services on GitHub are free of charge.  Users can create public or private storage.  The shared repository will be accessible over the internet to the world.  The private repository is limited and only viewable by the repository owner.

The aspects that are used to accomplish on the client-side vs. the server-side are where many clients or remote processors ask for and get service via a centrilized server or host computer.  Client computers give an interface to permit a computer user to ask for the server's service and show the results the server returns.  Servers wait for requests to get there from clients and then respond to them.  For example, GitHub Desktop is an application that allows you to interact with GitHub using a Graphic User Interface (GUI) instead of the command line or a web browser.  The GitHub Desktop means that the Client-Server architecture creates a way to imagine and organize repositories and branches and link your local filesystem with your GitHub account.

4) Cloud Computing:
   GitHub is considered Cloud-Computing due to the fact that the Git repository hosting service is a cloud-based source code management or version control system.  Cloud computing usually means many servers share resources like storage or computing power to complete a task, like calculating something, storing data, or serving resources to users.  Since there are so many servers, usually in different locations, this makes them less prone to errors, outages, and attacks, or in some cases, restrictions by companies or government policies.  GitHub is something like a social network site for programmers.  GitHub provides programmers an open environment to openly share and join forces on open-source computer code.  Some other cloud computing environments that I use are Google Drive and Word Online, with Word Online being integrated into OneDrive.  Both of these services are considered Software as a Service.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as "The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure.  The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface.  The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings."

Conclusion:

During this lab, I studied the course requirements for IT1025 and a summary of client-server architecture and GitHub.  To me, GitHub is remarkable, although a bit complicated.  However, with some research, I was able to complete the repository.  I'm excited to spend more time on the GitHub platform and study more on Cybersecurity which is my current IT passion.
