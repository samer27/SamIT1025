# Internet Protocol

a.  IP address is a shorter way of saying "Internet Protocol address."  IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces.  among other vital functions, they identify every device connected to the Internet, whether a web server, smartphone, mail server, or laptop.  So when you send an email, visit a website, or participate in a video conference, your computer sends data packets to the IP address of the other end of the connection and receives packets destined for its IP address.  Without the IP address asssigned to our computers, you would have to send paper letters and memos instead of emails.

After years of rapid Internet expansion, the pool of available unallocated addresses for the original Internet Protocol, known as IPv4, has been fully allocated to Internet Services and users.  That's why we need IPv6, the next generation of the Intetnet protocol that has a massively more significant address space than IPv4.

The numbers and names needed to reach another person on the Internet must be unique, so computers know where to find each other.  ICANN (Intetnet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) aligns these unique identifiers across the world.  Without that alignment, the world wouldn't have one global Internet.  It is also a not-for-profit partnership worldwide dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable, and interoperable.  In addition, it promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet's unique identifiers.

ICANN doesn't control the content on the Internet.  It cannot stop spam, and it doesn't deal with access to the Internet.  However, through its coordination role of the Internet's naming system, it does have an essential impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet.  "Universal resolvability" is a common term here.  It means that wherever you are on the network - and hence the word - you receive the same predictable results when you access the network.  Without this, you could end up with an Internet that worked entirely differently depending on your location on the globe.

# TCP/IP

a. TCP/IP means Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.  A protocol is a set of rules that govern how systems communicate.  For networking, they manage how data is transferred from one system to another.  It is a suite of communication protocols uses to interconnect network devices on the Internet.  A protocol suite is a collection of protocols that are designed to work together.  TCP/IP is also used as a communcations protocol in a private computer network.

The entire IP suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.  TCP and IP are the two main protocols, though others are includes in the suite.  The TCP/IP protocol suite functions as an abstraction layer between Internet applications and the routing and switching fabric.
