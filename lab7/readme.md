# Executive Summary

Lab7 Software Engineering consisted of practicing working with files and folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compression.  In addition, I defined the OOP (object-oriented programming) paradigm and practiced creating and diagramming software.  From this lab, I hope to learn how compressing a file affects the final document and the meaning of object-oriented programming.

# File Compression

a. Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files.  A zip file is a way of grouping or archiving multiple files to act like one file.  Say, for example, you want to email a folder of a Word document to someone.  One option is to attach each file individually, but it would take a long time, especially if there are many documents.  A sounder option would be to put all of the files in a zip file and then attach the zip file to your email.

Another advantage of zip files is compressed, making the total file size smaller.  As a result, if you're emailing a zip file to someone or posting it to the Web, it takes less time to upload, and your recipients will also be able to download it more quickly.

b. I noted the original file size to be 5.30 KB.  However, after compressing the file, it became 3 KB.  JPEG and SVG are both a type of image formats to store images.  However, JPEG is a raster image format and uses a lossy compression algorithm, and the image may lose some of its data.  In contrast, SVG is a text-based image format and uses mathematical structures to represent an image and is highly scalable.  JPEG images are used in photography applications, and SVG is used when high-resolution images are required.
