# Executive Summary

Lab7 Software Engineering consisted of practicing working with files and folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compression.  In addition, I defined the OOP (object-oriented programming) paradigm and practiced creating and diagramming software.  From this lab, I hope to learn how compressing a file affects the final document and the meaning of object-oriented programming.

# File Compression

a. Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files.  A zip file is a way of grouping or archiving multiple files to act like one file.  Say, for example, you want to email a folder of a Word document to someone.  One option is to attach each file individually, but it would take a long time, especially if there are many documents.  A sounder option would be to put all of the files in a zip file and then attach the zip file to your email.

Another advantage of zip files is compressed, making the total file size smaller.  As a result, if you're emailing a zip file to someone or posting it to the Web, it takes less time to upload, and your recipients will also be able to download it more quickly.

b. I noted the original file size to be 5.30 KB.  However, after compressing the file, it became 3 KB.  JPEG and SVG are both a type of image formats to store images.  However, JPEG is a raster image format and uses a lossy compression algorithm, and the image may lose some of its data.  In contrast, SVG is a text-based image format and uses mathematical structures to represent an image and is highly scalable.  JPEG images are used in photography applications, and SVG is used when high-resolution images are required.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

i. Methods are a special kind of function that is defined within a class.  Because these functions are indented under the class Shark, they are called methods.

An object, or property, is an instance of a class.  So then, you can take the Shark class defined above and use it to create an object or instance of it.

ii. The constructor method is used to initialize data.  It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

iii. Classes are like a blueprint or a prototype that you can define to create objects.  
An object is an instance of a class.
Creating an object from the class 'blueprint' is called instantiation.  Essentially, you instantiate an instance of the class and give that instance a name by which you will refer to it when accessing members and calling methods.  You can create as many object instances of a class as you desire.  Objects are instantiated from a class using the new keyword.
