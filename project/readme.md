# Executive Summary

Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that provides an open, distributed record of transactions between two parties. A “peer-to-peer” network is one where there is no server between the two nodes trying to communicate. Essentially, each node acts as a server and a client.

Supporters see blockchain as a tool to simplify all types of transactions: payments, contracts, etc.  Blockchain is considered a foundational technology, potentially creating new economic and social systems foundations. However, there are numerous concerns about Blockchain and its adoption. Consider the following:

Speed of adoption. Initially, there is a great deal of enthusiasm by a small group. However, adoption on a larger scale can take a significant number of years, even decades, for a worldwide acceptance of a new business method.

Governance. The banking sector, both in individual countries (U. S. Federal Reserve System) and the world at large (the International Monetary Fund), controls financial transactions. One purpose of these organizations is to avoid banking and economic systems collapse. Blockchain will result in the governance of financial transactions shifting away from these government-controlled institutions.

Smart contracts. The smart contract will re-shape how businesses interact. For example, it is possible for blockchain to automatically send payment to a vendor the instant the product is delivered to the customer. Such “self-executing” contracts are already taking place in banking and venture capital funding.

# Project

1. My project, blockchain, is about how blockchain can be utilized in the future to solve problems.  The basic concept of blockchain is simple: a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records.  However, it is easy to get mixed up, as we usually talk about blockchains. We also talk about the problems we are trying to solve.  This is the case in popular blockchain-based projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Blockchain” is usually strongly tied to concepts like transactions, smart contracts, or cryptocurrencies.

This makes understanding blockchains a more complex task than it needs to. Especially source-code-wisely.  I found a GitHub repository called NaiveChain created for demonstration and learning purposes.  It cannot be used in a public network since it does not have a “mining” algorithm (Proof of Stake of Proof of Work). It nonetheless implements the basic features for a functioning blockchain.

c. My overall experience of the course was excellent. IT1025 goes over many IT topics; however, I especially enjoyed that there were many different sources to study and not just sticking to one leading textbook. In addition, this course showed me that I have a passion for IT, specifically cybersecurity. For example, I did not realize the history of ciphers and how far back they date.  Also, I liked using Lucidchart to design flowcharts to help me better imagine an idea or topic.  
My next step to reach my career and academic goals are to finish the cybersecurity, post-degree professional certificate, and prepare for the CompTIA cybersecurity analyst exam.
