# Executive Summary

Working in Lab 4, we examined operating systems and practiced working at the command line of my Windows operating system.  In addition, we explored additional software, including an interactive coding environment, graphics, and diagrams.  For example, I learned that different file sizes require different file types and knowing when to use raster versus vector graphics.

# Python IDLE

d. Python Shell is a command-line tool that starts up the Python interpreter.  Thus, you can test simple programs and also write some short programs.  However, to write a more complex Python program, you need an editor.  On the other hand, IDLE has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package.  IDLE consists of the Python Shell and Text editor that supports highlights for Python grammar, etc. 

# Code Examples

i. Each variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable.  Likewise, every variable has a value, which is the infortion related to that variable.  The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs because any character can be applied to a variable to differentiate the different variables.  To illustarate this, following computer code for "Hello Python World" shows a variable:

message = "Hello Python world!"

print(message)

ii. In Python, assignment statements are used to assign objects to names.  The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equals sign (=), and the object on the right can be random expression that computes an object.  To display this, see the following computer code:

student = 'Sam'

print(student)

iii. A function makes part of your program reusable, so you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain actions once, which you can then use as many times as you like.  An example function as a message is shown:

age = 32

message = "Happy" + st(age) + "rd Birthday!"

print(message)

iv. Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.  It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.  Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes, and variables are instances (object) of these classes.

# Graphics

a. There's a reason small images lose quality when you enlarge them.  In other words, making an image bigger than its original size will cause a noticeable loss of quality.  It's because they're made up of thousands - sometimes even millions - of tiny little pixels.  The word for this type of image is raster.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90066230/137124954-d6f7a4fe-ce9b-4ead-93d5-dcfbfe5d51b3.png)

When you view a raster image at its original size or smaller, the pixels are invisible.  This is because these pixels are just too small to see.  They only become visible when you zoom in or make the image larger.  If an image needed to be cropped, then using a raster image would be appropriate.

In contrast, vector graphics can make an image any size, big or small, without losing quality.  The image has been enlarged in the example below, but there's no pixelation - not even a little bit.

This image quality is due to vectors being made of something more complex than pixels.  They're condensed using a unique form of geometry.  As a result, you're not likely to find vector graphics outside of professional design settings.  However, if you were resizing an image, then using a vector graphic would fit here.

b. It matters to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats.  If you don't understand which type of compression to use for different kinds of images, you'll likely end up with one of two results.  One, a picture that doesn't look as good as possible, and second, an image file size that is way larger than it needs to be.

Computer users think that they should only use image formats that use lossless compressions.  While lossless compression is superior for many kinds of images, it's not necessary for many others.  Lossless image compression means all the data from the original file is preservered.  On the other hand, Lossy compression removes some data from the original file and saves the image with reduced file size.  It's up to you, as the developer, to say how much data to disregard by setting the image compression rate.

c. File Formats

5. SVGGraphic

# File Properties

i. My image design was the Microsoft logo.  The image design included four "layers" that incorporated the four square color schemes of red, green, blue, and orange.    

ii. After viewing the "properties" portion on my svd file, I noticed the file size was 9.60KB.  I also noticed that the file type was an svg, the same type of file as the design environment as Vectr, the program that I created my logo.  Because GitHub does not accept the svg file type, I was forced to change the file type from an svg to a png.  A png (Portable Network Graphics) file is a raster or bitmap image file format.  A raster image comprises a fixed number of pixels (or building blocks) that form a complete picture.  Therefore, the image cannot be enlarged without distortion occurring (When you zoom in on a raster image, the pixels become visibly grainy.)  Standard raster images include png, jpg, and gif formats.

Meanwhile, an svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) file is a vector image file format.  A vector image uses geometric forms such as points, lines, curves, and shapes (polygons) to represent differnt image parts as discreate objects.  These forms can be individuallly editied.  As a result, a vector image remains crisp and clear at any resolution or size. 

# Conclusion

In Lab 4, we reviewed operating systems and practiced working at the command line of my Windows opeating system.  In addition, explored supplementary software, including an interactive programming environment, graphics, and diagrams.  From this lab, I'll take away how to create various design logos within the Vectr environment.
