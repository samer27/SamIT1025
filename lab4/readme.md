# Code Examples

i. Each variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable.  Likewise, every variable has a value, which is the infortion related to that variable.  The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs because any character can be applied to a variable to differentiate the different variables.  To illustarate this, following computer code for "Hello Python World" shows a variable:

message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)

ii. In Python, assignment statements are used to assign objects to names.  The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equals sign (=), and the object on the right can be random expression that computes an object.  To display this, see the following computer code:

student = 'Sam'
print(student)

iii. A function makes part of your program reusable, so you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain actions once, which you can then use as many times as you like.  An example function as a message is shown:

age = 32
message = "Happy" + st(age) + "rd Birthday!"
print(message)

iv. Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.  It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.  Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes, and variables are instances (object) of these classes.
